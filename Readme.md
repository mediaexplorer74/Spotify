# Spotify for Win10Mobile

"Boxify" (Spotify for XBox One) fork

Proof-of-concept (plays only 30 sec of each song...)

## My 2 cents
* Backend pre-configuration (Developer Spotify zone tuning: client id, app secret... )))
* Font/Element/Views resize... unaccurate, but fast.. sorry !


## Screenshots

## Very big problem
I not solved the "30 sec" problem.... so.... epic fail :((((

# Contribute!
There's still a TON of things missing from this proof-of-concept (MVP) and areas of improvement 

With best wishes,
