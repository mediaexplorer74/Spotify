# Spotify for Win10Mobile

"Boxify" (Spotify for XBox One) fork

Proof-of-concept (plays only 30 sec of each song...)

## My 2 cents
* English translation of app UI
* Project extension scheme


## Screenshots

# Contribute!
There's still a TON of things missing from this proof-of-concept (MVP) and areas of improvement 

With best wishes,
